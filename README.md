# Custom Map PCB Design

This repository contains the files and resources for creating a unique PCB design that features a custom map. This project is a blend of art and electronics, where a map (such as a city layout or geographical location) is etched onto the PCB as a visual design. This can serve as decorative art, functional circuitry, or even a personalized gift.
